Late last night, I wrote an about page. I woke up this morning and decided it was too cringe to remain.
All the same, it seems disingenuous to hide it altogether. It's a piece of this website's history. So you can read it <a href="aboutOld.html">here</a> if you'd like.
</p>

Well, not enough people make stupid useless websites and I decided to stop being part of the problem.
If you want to call me something, you can call me Petricourse.
This website is 100% homemade, in the sense that I am just making it myself out of raw HTML and CSS.
I bought the domain from Google Domains, and am using Github to store the website data. I am currently writing this text raw into an html file using Visual Studio Code.
I intend to put whatever I feel like on here. Probably mostly just insane ramblings about random topics and pictures that I like.
I hope one day the CSS will be so outlandish and there will be so many subpages with no consistent navigational paradigms that
this place will be a technicolor hell maze that nobody has any desire to ever visit.
</p>
<p>
Now that I think about it, I kind of wish I had bought the domain technicolorhellmaze.com instead of petricourse.com. Now <i>that's</i> a fucking band name.
