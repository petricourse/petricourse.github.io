<p>
It is 2:01 AM. About an hour ago, I learned that website domains are actually pretty cheap and 
decided that I could no longer live in a world where I did not have a website.

So I bought a website domain and went to work, using nothing more than HTML, CSS, and Github. Depending on when you read this,
I may have moved on to cooler, sleeker things, such as Javascript.

Maybe you want to know more about me. But I don't think I would like to say anything more. You may be able to deduce more about
what sort of person I am by seeing what's on this website. I can't get around that. However, I really don't like identity. 
I sort of dislike it a lot.
</p>
<p>
You'll never know my real name, because I don't want a name. You'll never know my gender, because god knows I don't need one of those.
Here, the words I type are my only definition.
</p>
<p>
God I love having a website. I can be as insufferable as I want, confident that nobody will ever have any reason to read these words and judge me.

But hey, if you do find this website, feel free to reach out to petricourse@gmail.com.
